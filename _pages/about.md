# About me <a id="about-me"></a>
My name is Yixin Zhu (祝亦欣), which can be pronounced as "Ee shin Joo". I am now a master student in School of Intelligence and Science, Nanjing university, supervised by Prof. [BeiBei Wang](https://wangningbei.github.io/). I obtained my bachelor's degree from Chang'an University.

My research interest mainly focuses on artificial intelligence generative content and computer graphics. I am trying to resolve some problems such as neural rendering and material generation.
